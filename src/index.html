    <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
    <p>

      first WDI program in Providence, RI! One of my favorite quotes is "Not all those who wander

      satisfying and left me feeling lost. So, I decided to take the skills I have acquired from
      my laundry list of various jobs and apply them to achieving an Associateâ€™s in Web Technology.
